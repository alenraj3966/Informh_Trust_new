                <h4>Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">
                    Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are serious mental health conditions that affect a
                    person's thinking, emotions, and behavior. Individuals may experience symptoms such as
                    hallucinations
                    (seeing or hearing things that are not real), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized thinking, and
                    a
                    lack of motivation or emotional expression. These conditions often interfere with daily functioning
                    and
                    relationships, but with consistent treatment, structured support, and compassionate care, many
                    individuals can experience significant improvement.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our facility provides a safe, therapeutic environment where residents
                    receive psychiatric care, medication management, counseling, and rehabilitation to promote recovery
                    and enhance quality of life.</p>
                <h4>Bipolar Affective Disorder</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Bipolar Affective Disorder is a mental health condition marked by extreme mood
                    swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During manic phases,
                    individuals may feel overly energetic, euphoric, or irritable, while depressive episodes can bring
                    feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and fatigue. Without proper treatment, these shifts can impact
                    daily life, work, relationships, and decision-making.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">At our center, we provide personalized care that includes mood stabilization
                    through medication, regular psychiatric monitoring, therapeutic interventions, and a supportive
                    environment to help individuals lead balanced and fulfilling lives.</p>
                <h4>Chronic Depression</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Chronic Depression, also known as Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia),
                    is a long-term form of depression that lasts for years. Individuals may experience a continuous low
                    mood, lack of interest in daily activities, low self-esteem, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.
                    Though the symptoms may be less intense than major depression, their long-lasting nature can
                    severely impact a person's quality of life. </p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our facility offers compassionate care, regular psychiatric support,
                    counseling, and structured daily activities to help manage symptoms and support emotional
                    well-being.</p>

                <h4>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">OCD is a mental health condition characterized by unwanted, recurring thoughts
                    (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that individuals feel driven to
                    perform. These patterns can interfere with daily life, causing significant distress and anxiety.
                    Common obsessions include fears of contamination or harm, while compulsions may involve excessive
                    cleaning, checking, or counting. </p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">At our center, individuals with OCD receive structured therapy, including
                    behavioral interventions, psychiatric care, and emotional support to help manage symptoms and
                    improve functioning.</p>
                <h4>Intellectual Disabilities (ID) with Psychiatric Symptoms</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">ID involve limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior,
                    affecting daily living skills, communication, and social interaction. When individuals with ID also
                    experience psychiatric symptoms—such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, or psychosis—their
                    challenges become more complex and require specialized care.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our center provides integrated support for individuals with both intellectual
                    disabilities and co-occurring mental health conditions. Services include psychiatric evaluation,
                    behavior management, personalized therapeutic programs, and compassionate caregiving to promote
                    stability, dignity, and improved quality of life.</p>

                <h4>Personality Disorders</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Personality Disorders are long-standing patterns of thoughts, feelings, and
                    behaviors that deviate significantly from cultural expectations, causing difficulties in
                    relationships, work, and daily functioning. These patterns often begin in adolescence or early
                    adulthood and can lead to distress or impairment over time. Common types include Borderline,
                    Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Avoidant Personality Disorders, among others. Individuals may struggle
                    with emotional regulation, interpersonal conflict, self-image, and impulse control.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our center provides structured therapeutic interventions, psychiatric care,
                    and supportive counseling tailored to the needs of individuals with personality disorders, helping
                    them lead more stable, fulfilling lives.</p>

                <h4>Age-related Psychiatric Conditions</h4>

                <p class="text-dark mb-3">As individuals age, they may experience unique mental health challenges
                    related to physical decline, social isolation, cognitive changes, and chronic illnesses. Age-related
                    psychiatric conditions commonly include dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, late-onset depression,
                    anxiety, and delirium. These conditions can significantly affect memory, behavior, and emotional
                    well-being, impacting both the individual and their caregivers.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our center offers compassionate, specialized care for older adults through
                    psychiatric assessment, cognitive therapies, medication management, and supportive environments
                    tailored to promote dignity, comfort, and quality of life in later years.</p>
                <h4>Substance-Induced Psychosis</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Substance-Induced Psychosis occurs when the use of or withdrawal from drugs,
                    alcohol, or certain medications triggers symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions,
                    confusion, or disorganized thinking. These symptoms can be temporary or, in some cases, lead to
                    longer-term psychiatric conditions if left untreated.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our facility provides comprehensive care, including detoxification support,
                    psychiatric stabilization, medication management, and counseling to help individuals recover safely
                    and prevent recurrence. We also offer rehabilitation services and family support to promote
                    long-term recovery and reintegration.</p>
                <h4>Psychosocial Disabilities</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Psychosocial disabilities refer to the challenges faced by individuals with
                    mental health conditions that impact their ability to participate fully in society. These
                    disabilities may affect social interactions, employment, education, and daily living activities,
                    often resulting from conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">At our center, we focus on holistic support that includes psychiatric care,
                    counseling, skill development, and community integration programs. Our goal is to empower
                    individuals with psychosocial disabilities to lead fulfilling, independent lives with dignity and
                    respect.</p>

                <h4>Homeless or Abandoned Individuals with Severe Mental Illness</h4>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Individuals experiencing severe mental illness who are homeless or abandoned
                    face profound challenges, including lack of shelter, access to healthcare, and social support. These
                    vulnerable populations often suffer from untreated psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia,
                    bipolar disorder, or severe depression, which can exacerbate their isolation and health risks.</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-3">Our organization is committed to outreach, rescue, and rehabilitation services
                    tailored to meet the complex needs of these individuals. We provide emergency shelter, psychiatric
                    evaluation, medication, counseling, and ongoing care aimed at restoring dignity, stability, and
                    hope.</p>
